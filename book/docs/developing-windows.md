# Windows Development

Generally we do our development on WSL (See [developing-envsetup](developing-envsetup.md)).
Sometimes we need to install stuff on the windows side...

## Setup

- install pixi
- install [gitforwindows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- install github cli (`pixi global install gh`)
