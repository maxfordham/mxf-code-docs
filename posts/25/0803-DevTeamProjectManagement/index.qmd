Clients and Stakeholders define [projects](#projects). 
To deliver projects we try to adopt [agile methodologies](https://agilemanifesto.org/). 
The is delivered through [2-weekly sprints](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprints), coordinated by sprint planning meetings.

See "[learn-scrum](https://github.com/imalitavakoli/learn-scrum)" for a quick intro into the broad principles.


## Projects

- Development projects are defined on the Wiki: https://wiki.maxfordham.com/Main/ProjectTopic
- Projects must have pre-agreed Clients, Stakeholders and Budgets
  - When a project becomes active ("Running") it must have an associated code in Timesheets
  - See [NonFeeEarningTimesheetWorkTypesExplained](https://wiki.maxfordham.com/Main/NonFeeEarningTimesheetWorkTypesExplained)
- A project should have an equivalent [maxfordham Github Project](https://github.com/orgs/maxfordham/projects) for task management.
- A project will be delivered through the completion of many sprints (and milestones).

## Sprints

- 2-weekly meetings are used for sprint-planning where tasks are defined and assigned
- ideally the end of a sprint achieves a GH milestone, in GH tasks (issues) can be added to milestones
- uncompleted tasks are put back into the backlog

## Key People

- "Scrum Master": this will typically be Dan or John overseeing the technical progress of a project.
- "Product Owner": this is the client that we are producing for. Outcomes must be presented to them.
- "Scrum Developers": the people delivering the work.
